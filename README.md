# Project Synopsis 
This program (which is a open ended final project I chose for CS 126 at UIUC) is used to visualize a shortest path between two points with map that consists of blocks and weighted connections. The user will be able to make a map that consists of weighted nodes and blocked nodes and it finds the shortest path according to what the user inputs on the map

# Set Up
Simply use VCS on a C++ IDE and run path_finder_app. The controls on how to intereact with the visual map will be on the top part of the window of the program.
