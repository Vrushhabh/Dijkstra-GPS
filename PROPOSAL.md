# Overall project idea
I was using google maps a few days ago to go to Insomia Cookies around very late at night and was wondering about what project to make. And then the idea came in my head to make my project on some visual path finding that finds a short path between 2 points given the map (having obstructions (like bulidings in real life) that the user can draw in or making files that can be loaded into as maps). I know that this will be no where near complex as the implementations Google uses but this would be a nice fundemental point of view of seeing how a technology I use a lot works.

# Time Line
The first week I plan on making the UI for the program and finalizing how the overall program will look and add some draw in functionality.
The second week I plan on making the implementation of the path finder class and testing to see if it works.
In the third week I plan on mixing the path finder class and the board class to get a visual of the shortest path.

# Extra Features
If I happen to to finish early I might try to make other path finding implementations and compare them to each other with different path colors.
